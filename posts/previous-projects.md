In the 2020 to 2021 school year the club had just started, so most of our focus was dedicated to 
trying to figure out how everything worked as well as what the best way to run the club was. Our 
robot was farily primivte in terms of what it could do, but our team still put their all into
improving it. The robot was named 'Jeff Bezos' after the billionare CEO of Amazon, and while it 
had a ring-shooter installed, it was non-functional.
